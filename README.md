# Statistical-Quality-Control
Here are the 2 main projects that I've done during the course.
* Plotting **EWMA** & **CUSUM** control charts in Python besides developing their required function from scratch. I also used **Monte Carlo** simulation to recognize the value of **ARL** (in 10000 iterations) concerning a few combinations of related parameters in both control charts.
* Using Quality Control methods in Notebook manufacturing.
